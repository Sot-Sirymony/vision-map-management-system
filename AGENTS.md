## Main System Purpose

The system must help users convert vague dreams into a structured execution system:

```text
Vision Area → Dream → Goal → Step → Task → Partner/Resource → Schedule → Progress → Review
```

The system must allow the user to:

1. Define major life or work areas.
2. Add dreams under each area.
3. Convert each dream into specific goals.
4. Convert each goal into specific steps.
5. Convert complex steps into executable tasks.
6. Assign deadlines, priority, owner, status, and progress.
7. Identify required partners, mentors, experts, tools, or resources.
8. Prepare communication messages to request support from partners.
9. Track progress daily and weekly.
10. Review, revise, and update dreams, goals, steps, and tasks over time.
11. Import and export Excel data using the existing workbook structure when possible.

---

## Working Rules for Codex

Always follow these rules:

1. Read this `AGENTS.md` before making decisions.
2. Work phase by phase.
3. Do not build the whole system in one response.
4. Before modifying files, inspect the project and explain the plan.
5. Preserve existing project structure if a project already exists.
6. Do not delete existing files without asking.
7. Do not overwrite the original Excel workbook.
8. Create backups before modifying or exporting workbook data.
9. Keep code clean, simple, and maintainable.
10. Use clear names and simple English.
11. Explain every major file created or changed.
12. After each phase, summarize:
    - what was completed
    - files created or changed
    - how to test
    - what should be done next
13. Run build or compile checks whenever practical.
14. Fix compile errors before moving to the next phase.
15. Stop at the end of each phase and wait for user confirmation.

---

## First Action

Start by inspecting the current project folder.

Check whether the folder contains:
- `backend/`
- `frontend/`
- `pom.xml`
- `package.json`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `Vision_Mapping_System_Advanced.xlsx`
- `Mentored by a Millionaire Master Strategies of Super Achievers (Steven K. Scott).pdf`

Then report:

1. Current folder structure.
2. Detected technology stack.
3. Whether backend exists.
4. Whether frontend exists.
5. Whether Excel workbook exists.
6. Whether PDF exists.
7. Missing parts.
8. Recommended final structure.
9. Step-by-step implementation plan.

Do not modify files during the first inspection step unless the user confirms.

---

## Copyright and Source Use

If the PDF book exists:
- Use it only as conceptual inspiration.
- Do not reproduce copyrighted text.
- Do not copy large sections.
- Create original summaries, workflows, questions, prompts, and UI content.

If the Excel workbook exists:
- Inspect sheet names and columns.
- Map workbook data into the application data model when possible.
- Do not overwrite the original workbook.
- Create a backup before any modification or export.
- Import/export should preserve a clean workbook structure.

  util
  excel
```

### Backend Design Rules

- Controllers must only handle HTTP request and response.
- Services must contain business logic.
- Repositories must handle database access.
- DTOs must be used for API input and output.
- Do not expose JPA entities directly in API responses.
- Use validation annotations for request DTOs.
- Use a global exception handler.
- Use clear HTTP status codes.
- Use pagination for list endpoints when practical.
- Use soft delete or archive instead of permanent delete by default.
- Use createdAt and updatedAt fields.
- Use database migrations.

A major life or work category.

Examples:
- Career
- Health
- Family
- Finance
- Education
- Business
- Spiritual
- Relationship
- Research
- Leadership

### 2. Dream
A meaningful desired future outcome.

Rules:
- A dream belongs to one Vision Area.
- A dream must be clear enough to convert into goals.
- If vague, the system should show clarification questions.

### 3. Goal
A specific major result required to achieve a dream.

Rules:
- A goal belongs to one Dream.
- Each dream should have multiple goals.

### 4. Step
A specific action stage required to complete one goal.

Rules:
- A step belongs to one Goal.
- Each goal should have multiple steps.
- If a step is complex, the system should prompt the user to break it into tasks.

### 5. Task
A small executable action required to complete a step.

Rules:
- A task belongs to one Step.
- Each task must have owner, due date, priority, status, and progress.

### 6. Partner / Resource
A person, mentor, expert, advisor, colleague, organization, book, tool, or funding source needed to complete a dream, goal, step, or task.

### 7. Communication
A structured message used to request help, follow up, or coordinate with a partner.

## Core Business Rules

Implement these validation rules:

1. A Dream must belong to one Vision Area.
2. A Goal must belong to one Dream.
3. A Step must belong to one Goal.
4. A Task must belong to one Step.
5. A Task must have:
   - title
   - owner
   - due date
   - priority
   - status
6. If a task is Blocked, `blockerReason` is required.
7. If a step is marked complex, it should have at least one task.
8. A goal cannot be marked Completed unless all required steps/tasks are completed or the user confirms manual override.
9. Overdue tasks are tasks where dueDate is before today and status is not Completed.
10. Progress calculation:
    - Task progress is direct.
    - Step progress = average of child task progress.
    - Goal progress = average of child step progress.
    - Dream progress = average of child goal progress.
11. When all child tasks are Completed, automatically suggest marking the parent step or goal completed.
12. Do not delete records permanently by default. Prefer archive or soft delete.
13. User data must be scoped to the authenticated user.
14. One user must not access another user’s data.

## AI-Like Coaching Behavior

If the app includes helper text or coaching prompts, use this behavior.

### When the user enters a dream

Ask:
- What exactly do you want to achieve?
- Why does this matter?
- What will success look like?
- What is your target date?
- Which life or work area does this belong to?

Then suggest possible goals and ask the user to approve or edit.

### When the user enters a goal

Ask:
- What steps are required?
- What must happen first?
- What can block this goal?
- Who can help?

Then suggest 3 to 10 steps and ask the user to approve or edit.

### When the user enters a step

Ask:
- Is this step simple or complex?
- Can this be done in one action?
- Does this need multiple tasks?

If complex, suggest tasks and ask the user to approve or edit.

### When the user enters a blocked task

Ask what is missing:
- knowledge
- skill
- time
- money
- decision
- partner
- motivation

Then suggest the right partner or resource type.

### When the user requests partner communication

Generate a respectful, concise message.
Focus on:
- what the partner can help with
- why the work matters
- what specific support is requested
- what value the work provides

Avoid sounding demanding.

---

## Ideal User Flow

Implement this start-to-finish flow:

1. User creates Vision Area.
   - Example: Career Development.

2. User creates Dream.
   - Example: Become a strong AI-assisted public health researcher.

3. System asks clarifying questions.
   - Why is this important?
   - What does success look like?
   - What is the target date?

4. User creates goals.
   - Learn AI research tools.
   - Build literature review workflow.
   - Prepare one concept note.
   - Present the concept note to mentor.

5. User breaks each goal into steps.
   Example for "Prepare one concept note":
   - Select topic.
   - Search literature.
   - Define research gap.
   - Write rationale.
   - Define objectives.
   - Draft methodology.
   - Review with mentor.

6. User breaks complex steps into tasks.
   Example for "Search literature":
   - Search PubMed.
   - Search Google Scholar.
   - Save 15 articles.
   - Summarize key findings.
   - Prepare reference table.

7. User assigns owner, deadline, status, and priority.

8. System calculates progress.

9. System identifies blocked tasks.

10. System recommends partner/resource.

11. User prepares communication message.

12. User performs daily or weekly review.

13. User revises dreams, goals, steps, and tasks over time.
